                <p> ES6 is a large and important update to JavaScript that I'm really excited about. Whether you are building with a framework like React or websites in Vanilla JS, you are going to love everything about ES6. Wes' tutorials are among some of the best in our industry — I'd recommend learning ES6 with Wes to anyone looking to modernize and improve their JS skillset.ES6 refers to version 6 of the ECMA Script programming language. ECMA Script is the standardized name for JavaScript, and version 6 is the next version after version 5, which was released in 2011. It is a major enhancement to the JavaScript language, and adds many more features intended to make large-scale software development easier.ECMAScript, or ES6, was published in June 2015. It was subsequently renamed to ECMAScript 2015. Web browser support for the full language is not yet complete, though major portions are supported. Major web browsers support some features of ES6. However, it is possible to use software known as a transpiler to convert ES6 code into ES5, which is better supported on most browsers.

                        Let us now look at some major changes that ES6 brings to JavaScript.</p>
                <p class="light">ECMAScript (ES) is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMAScript International. It is used by applications to enable client-side scripting. Languages like JavaScript, Jscript and ActionScript are governed by this specification. This tutorial introduces you to ES6 implementation in JavaScript.This tutorial has been prepared for JavaScript developers who are keen on knowing the difference between ECMAScript 5 and ECMAScript 6. It is useful for those who want to learn the latest developments in the language and implement the same in JavaScript.JavaScript ES6 brings new syntax and new awesome features to make your code more modern and more readable. It allows you to write less code and do more. ES6 introduces us to many great features like arrow functions, template strings, class destruction, Modules… and more. Let’s take a look.</p>
